## 🚀 **Setup/Installation Instructions:**  

### **Prerequisites:**  
- **Oracle Database** installed and running.  
- **SQL client** (e.g., SQL*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer) to execute scripts.  

### **Steps:**  

1. **📥 Clone or Download the Project** – Obtain the SQL script file (`Database Assignment Group 66 (Softcopy).docx`).  
2. **⚙️ Execute the Script**  
   - Open the SQL script in your SQL client.  
   - Run the script to create tables, constraints, indexes, and insert sample data.  
     ```sql
     -- Example: Execute the entire script in Oracle SQL Developer or SQL*Plus.
     ```  
3. **✅ Verify the Database**  
   - Check that all tables are created (e.g., `Customers`, `Bookings`, `Package`, etc.).  
   - Confirm sample data is inserted by running simple queries like:  
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Customers;
     SELECT * FROM Bookings;
     ```  
4. **🔎 Run Queries**  
   - Use the provided queries (Part 4 of the script) to analyze data, such as identifying high-value customers or inactive users.  
   - Example query to find high-value customers:  
     ```sql
     SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustName, SUM(p.PayPrice) AS TotalSpent
     FROM Customers c
     JOIN Bookings b ON c.CustomerID = b.CustomerID
     JOIN Payment p ON b.BookingID = p.BookingID
     GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustName
     HAVING SUM(p.PayPrice) > 2000;
     ```
